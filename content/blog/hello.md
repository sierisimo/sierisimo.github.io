I always think about writing a blog or having a place to complain.
Having a single space of the internet where I can go and rant about anything.

_Back in the day..._ we had **MySpace** (I never actually created an account),
we had **Hi5**, **Orkut**, **Fotolog**, **Metroflog**, etc. All social networks
with the intention of bringing a social space to each person where
they can show themselves.

Nowadays are **Instagram**, **Snapchat**, **Facebook**, **TikTok**, all with the
same intention: profit, I mean, social communication.

But the problem has been always the same: Those are third party places,
depending on others, depending on a company finding a profit,
which always implies this: The company owns the existence of that small space.

And then is 2025... I'm starting a blog, like the old days,
just to have a single place where to rant, where to share toughs,
where to place examples or my content on talks I give.

Also I'm tired of the rage bait, the short video format and
because we are social animals, we need to communicate and
I'm also a nerd that is always pushing himself into doing
the work by hand (at least once).

This time, I'm using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) as a static site
generator. Because hugo seemed to overloaded, other projects have
to many plugins or configurations and... I don't want to write a bunch
of tags when I just want to rant or express what I think.

So Zola is for now.
