# About me

Hey! My name is... well, my name is Sinuhe, but no one calls me that, all my
friends call me **Sier**.

This is my personal blog, I actually just bought the domain a while ago and
wanted to do something with it.

I publish stuff [here](https://dev.to/sierisimo) and there, but have never made
_the habit_.

I want to share my knowledge, because at some point I was lost and finding blogs
and people sharing their work, their findings, their issues, helped me understand
more and grow along with the authors.

And I want you to grow...

And I want to grow...

So, welcome! To my blog!
